                        Sunwoo Han (Korean: 한선우) hails from South Korea, with possible links to the Insa-dong
                        neighborhood in Seoul. As a chef in her early life, she was involved in an incident relating
                        to her wind-like radiant powers at the restaurant she worked at, causing a "freak storm"
                        that all but destroyed the building. Sunwoo fled the scene soon after. Later on, Sunwoo would be
                        recruited by the VALORANT Protocol to become its tenth agent, "Jett". Whilst working for the
                        Protocol however, an incident occurred in Venice that destroyed part of the city.

                        souls of people that she kills. After being affected by a disastrous event involving
                        machines, Mondragón has a strong dislike for technology and humanity, believing herself and
                        her fellow Radiants to be the true future for Earth. Before her time as a VALORANT Protocol
                        agent, she set up a sanctuary to help people escape from Kingdom and heal, establishing a
                        community there and becoming their protector and avenger.

                        Tayane Alves is an engineer coming from Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, with a strong enthusiasm for
                        explosives and paint - usually combined. Holding strong objections towards Kingdom Corporation's
                        operations in Bahia, Alves was involved in driving the company out of her home state and forcing
                        them to abandon their sites there, the marks of her tools staining the plots as a testament to
                        her victories. Hired since then to work for the VALORANT Protocol as its twelfth agent, "Raze",
                        Alves now sows her chaos against bigger threats to Earth.
